关于GitHub Pages 404 的一种解决方案

I had just one commit with all my files. I pushed an empty commit, refreshed the page and it worked.

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"
git push
```

If this doesn't work, as @Hendrikto pointed out in the comments, check out the Github status page and make sure GitHub Pages are operational.
